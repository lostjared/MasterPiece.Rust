MasterPiece Puzzle Game - Rust Edition

This is going to be a Recode of one of my first projects but this time in Rust.

How to Play:
Use the arrow keys to move the blocks
press Up arrow to swap colors
Press A and S to shift the blocks left/right
Line up 3 or more in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line to clear

Just started this project so its got some work to be done!

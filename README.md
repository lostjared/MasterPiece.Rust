MasterPiece Puzzle Game - Rust Edition
This originally was a project I worked on when I was a teenager learning C++. I made a typo and misspelled the name of the game.
I kept the graphics for this version so it looks like the original version. It was based on an Atari 2600 ROM I had been playing at the time.
I recoded this game from scratch in Rust trying to keep the same look as the original. Works for Windows/Linux/MacOS


How to Play:
Arrow keys Move blocks A and S rotate blocks Up arrow to shift colors
line up 3 or more in a row horizontal, vertical, or diagonal of the same color to clear.
Clear as many lines as possible before running out of space. As you progress difficulty increases.

MasterPiece Puzzle Game - Rust Edition

This is going to be a Recode of one of my first C++ projects but this time in Rust.

How to Play:
Arrow keys Move blocks A and S rotate blocks Up arrow to shift colors
line up 3 or more in a row horizontal, vertical, or diagonal of the same color to clear.
Clear as many lines as possible before running out of space. As you progress difficulty increases.

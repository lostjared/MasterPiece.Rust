MasterPiece Puzzle Game - Rust Edition

This project revisits a game I initially developed as a teenager while learning C++. Due to a misspelling in the original game's name, I decided to retain this unique title for authenticity. The visuals are preserved from that era, mirroring the classic gameplay of an Atari 2600 ROM game I was fond of. Recreated from the ground up in Rust, this version aims to replicate the nostalgic aesthetic while being compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

Game Instructions:
* Movement: Use the Arrow keys to navigate the blocks around the playing field.
* Rotation: Press 'A' and 'S' to rotate the blocks.
* Color Shifting: The Up Arrow key changes the block colors.
* Objective: Align 3 or more blocks of the same color in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to clear them from the board.
* Goal: Eliminate as many lines as possible to avoid filling up the space. The game becomes more challenging as you advance.
